.SH NAME
firewall.conf \- ConnMan firewall configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fIConnMan\fP's firewall is configured with \fI@configdir@/firewall.conf\fP and
files residing in \fI@configdir@/firewall.d/\fP. The files can be named
anything, as long as they end in \fBfirewall.conf\fP. Firewall configuration
files can define policies for managed iptables chains in table filter. Both
static and dynamic rules for service types can be defined, including tethering.
The rules defined in each file are added in sequence. Policies in the last read
configuration file overrule the previous policy setting. Policies can be set
only in static rules (General section) and are set for the default iptables
chains INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT.
.SH "DESCRIPTION OF CONNMAN FIREWALL"
.P
In general the firewall configuration in connman works as follows:
.IP
Rules are loaded as general, tethering and service type specific rules
.IP
Rules are applied only for the iptables filter table
.IP
Rules are added using managed chains only, no chain management with configs
.IP
Rules in General section are applied at start and removed at shutdown
.IP
Rules in tethering section are enabled/disabled when tethering is on/off
.IP
Rules for service types are enabled/disabled when service goes online/offline
.SH CONFIGURATION LOADING
.P
Connman supports firewall configurations for both general (permanent) settings
and for each connected service type. The main configuration is always as
@configdir@/connman/firewall.conf and rest of the configurations provided by
packages or installed by user are searched from @configdir@/connman/firewall.d/.
The configuration files must have \fB*firewall.conf\fP suffix and the file names
must not include other characters than letters or numbers.
.P
The configuration files from @configdir@/connman/firewall.d/ are read in
alphabetical order after the main @configdir@/connman/firewall.conf is read. If
the file @configdir@/connman/firewall.conf is omitted, then only the firewall
configurations from @configdir@/connman/firewall.d/ are read.
.TP
The section names are case sensitive. Regular key file format is used.
.SH USED KEYS
.P
The following keys are supported and the generic format is PROTOCOL.CHAIN.TYPE,
where:
.IP
PROTOCOL = IP protocol, either IPv4 or IPv6
.IP
CHAIN = iptables chain name, one of: INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT
.IP
TYPE = the key type, RULES for setting rules and POLICY for setting policy
.P
Content for each key must be defined on one line and only the first key in a
group is processed.
.P
The keys are:
.IP
IPv4.INPUT = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table INPUT chain.
.IP
IPv4.OUTPUT = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table OUTPUT chain.
.IP
IPv4.FORWARD = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table FORWARD chain.
.IP
IPv4.INPUT.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table INPUT chain.
.IP
IPv4.OUTPUT.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table OUTPUT chain.
.IP
IPv4.FORWARD.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table FORWARD chain.
.IP
IPv6.INPUT = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table INPUT chain.
.IP
IPv6.OUTPUT = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table OUTPUT chain.
.IP
IPv6.FORWARD = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table FORWARD chain.
.IP
IPv6.INPUT.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table INPUT chain.
.IP
IPv6.OUTPUT.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table OUTPUT chain.
.IP
IPv6.FORWARD.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table FORWARD chain.
.P
RULES and POLICY processing differ from each other. RULES are appended to the
rule list of the section in reading order. But the last POLICY in configuration
files (only allowed in General section) overrules all previous POLICY keys set
for the CHAIN with given PROTOCOL.
.SH RULE FORMAT
.P
Rules follow iptables rule format, for reference see:
.URL "https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html" "https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html"
.P
Rules are separated with semicolons (;). All rules for a key must be on one 
line.
.P
Rules can be commented out with hash tag (#) as first character. Commented rules
are simply ignored. For example:
.IP
.nf

[General]

IPv4.INPUT.RULES = #-p udp -m udp --dport 23 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 24 -j ACCEPT

.P
Will discard the first --dport 23 rule and use the second --dport 24 rule
.SS
Each rule:
.TP
Has to have one target (-j TARGET) which is the bare minimum of the rule.
.TP
Can have 0...1 protocol matches (-p protocol)..
.TP
Can have 0...2 match speficiers (-m match)
.TP
Can have 0...2 port switches either with a protocol modifier (-m protocol) or with multiport modifier (-m multiport).
.SS
Targets:
.P
The targets (-j TARGET) are the same as with default iptables: ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, LOG and QUEUE.
.SS
Protocols:
.P
Protocols (-p protocol) are the same as with iptables: tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, icmpv6, ipv6-icmp, esp, ah, sctp, mh, dccp and the special keyword all. These can be given in numeric format as well.
.SS
Disabled switches:
.P
Following switches are disabled and if a rule contains any of them the rule will be ignored:
.IP
All chain modifiers, since rules are added to managed chains, following modifiers are disabled: --append, -A, --delete, -D, --delete-chain, -X, --flush, -F, --insert, -I, --new-chain, -N, --policy, -P, --rename-chain, -E, --replace, -R, --zero, -Z
.IP
Destination speficiers are disabled (enabled later): --source, --src, -s,
--destination, --dst, -d, --to-destination, --from-destination
.IP
Some matches (with -m) are disabled (cause crash or commit errors). IPv4: comment, state, iprange, recent, owner. IPv6: comment, state, iprange, recent, owner, ttl
.P
Interface specifiers (--in-interface, -i, --out-interface, -o) are not allowed in tethering or service type sections: 
.SH CONFIGURATION: GENERAL SECTION
.P
General section contains the main static firewall rules. In this section both
RULES and POLICY types are allowed.
.P
RULES are read from each General section and added in sequence. The last POLICY
that is defined for a CHAIN with given PROTOCOL overrules the previous
definitions.
.P
Being static rules the interface specifiers (--in-interface, -i,
--out-interface, -o) are allowed in the General section. 
.SH CONFIGURATION: TETHERING SECTION
.P
The tethering mode configuration is included as builtin feature. When tethering
is enabled a default rules to accept all traffic from the tethering adapter is
used. The rules for tethering can be added later on to be more restrictive.
.P
Tethering rules are applied only for WiFi tethering, i.e., using a hotspot.
For usb tethering the default rules apply regardless of the [tethering] rules
configuration.
.P
The tethering rules must be complete. If there is at least one rule set, no
default rules will be added as they would make these custom rules set in
[tethering] unnecessary by allowing all traffic. Only RULES can be defined in
tethering section.
.P
For this, for example following rules could be enabled to allow only DHCP and
DNS, into, e.g., /etc/connman/firewall.d/42-tethering-firewall.conf
.nf
.IP
[tethering]

IPv4.INPUT.RULES = -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
IPv6.INPUT.RULES = -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
.SH CONFIGURATION: SERVICE TYPES
.P
The service type section supports only RULES type keys. The rules defined in
the service type sections are enabled when a service of that given type becomes
READY or ONLINE and are disabled when the service becomes IDLE, DISCONNECT or
FAILURE.
.P
When a rule is enabled, it will have the interface used by the service added
into the rule. For rules in chain INPUT the interface is added as incoming
interface (-i <interface>). For rules in chains FORWARD and OUTPUT the interface
is added as outgoing interface (-o <interface>).
.P
The service types that are supported (defined by enum connman_service_type in
include/service.h):
