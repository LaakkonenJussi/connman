Connman firewall configuration in general
*****************************************

In general the firewall configuration in connman works as follows:
 - Rules are loaded as general, tethering and service type specific rules
 - Rules are applied only for the iptables filter table
 - Rules are added using managed chains only, no chain management with configs
   - Rules are applied to connman-INPUT|FORWARD|OUTPUT chains
 - Rules in General section are applied at start and removed at shutdown
 - Rules in tethering section are enabled/disabled when tethering is on/off
 - Rules for service types are enabled/disabled when service goes online/offline

Connman firewall configuration file loading
===========================================

Connman supports firewall configurations for both general (permanent) settings
and for each connected service type. The main configuration is always as
CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.conf and rest of the configurations provided by
packages or installed by user are searched from CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.d/.
The configuration files must have *firewall.conf suffix and the file names must
not include other characters than letters or numbers.

The configuration files from CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.d/ are read in
alphabetical order after the main CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.conf is read. If
the file CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.conf is omitted, then only the firewall
configurations from CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.d/ are read.

When multiple different rule files are used the POLICY for specific chain is
used from the latest definition of that POLICY in configuration files. The rules
are are appended to the internal list of rules as they are read for both General
section and service & tethering sections. For an example of this refer to
Example1.

The section names in configuration files are case sensitive. Regular key file
format is used.

Connman firewall rule ordering
==============================

Rules from General section in firewall.conf are considered as base rules. These
are kept as last ones in the iptables list to allow exceptions on top of them.
The rules from firewall config files in CONFIGDIR/connman/firewall.d have their
rules from General section set up before the General section rules from
firewall.conf.

When a service that has dynamic rules in any configuration is connected the
rules are inserted on top of the managed chain when the service is in READY
state or tethering is enabled.

Reloading of configurations is half-way supported. Changes in existing files are
not detected as of now (TODO). To make ConnMan detect the changes restart is
required. Adding new or removing old configuration is supported with systemctl
reload command. In case a new config is added the rules are loaded in order to
the internal lists but are not set in correct order into iptables. In such case
service must be re-connected (e.g., WiFi) or ConnMan restarted (General rules)
to get the order correct.

Keys in sections
================

The following keys are supported and the generic format is PROTOCOL.CHAIN.TYPE,
where:
 - PROTOCOL = IP protocol, either IPv4 or IPv6
 - CHAIN = iptables chain name, one of: INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT
 - TYPE = the key type, RULES for setting rules and POLICY for setting policy

Content for each key must be defined on one line and only the first key in a
group is processed.

The keys are:

IPv4.INPUT = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table INPUT chain.
IPv4.OUTPUT = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table OUTPUT chain.
IPv4.FORWARD = #Rules set into IPv4 filter table FORWARD chain.
IPv4.INPUT.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table INPUT chain.
IPv4.OUTPUT.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table OUTPUT chain.
IPv4.FORWARD.POLICY = #Default policy for filter table FORWARD chain.
IPv6.INPUT = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table INPUT chain.
IPv6.OUTPUT = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table OUTPUT chain.
IPv6.FORWARD = #Rules set into IPv6 filter table FORWARD chain.
IPv6.INPUT.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table INPUT chain.
IPv6.OUTPUT.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table OUTPUT chain.
IPv6.FORWARD.POLICY_IPv6 = #Default policy for IPv6 filter table FORWARD chain.

RULES and POLICY processing differ from each other. RULES are appended to the
rule list of the section in reading order. But the last POLICY in configuration
files (only allowed in General section) overrules all previous POLICY keys set
for the CHAIN with given PROTOCOL.

Rule formatting and exceptions
==============================

Rules follow iptables rule format, for reference see:
https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html

Rules are separated with semicolons (;). All rules for a key must be on one
line.

Used options in rules are checked for their appropriate input values, the
protocol and/or match values are checked as well. If option is not supported or
there are missing/invalid values the rule is ignored. Negations in rules are
supported as with iptables command.

Each rule:
 - Has to have one target (-j|--jump TARGET) or goto (-g|--goto) which is the
   bare minimum of the rule
 - Can have 0...1 protocol matches (-p|--protocol protocol)
 - Can have 0...2 match speficiers (-m|--match match),
   - E.g., to allow one attempt per second to telnet:
     -p udp -m udp --dport 23 -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 1 -j ACCEPT
 - Can have
   - 0...2 port switches with a protocol modifier (-m|--match protocol):
     --destination-port, --dport, --source-port, --sport 
   - 0...1 port switches with multiport modifier (-m|--match multiport):
     --destination-ports, --dports, --source-ports, --sports, --port, --ports,
     --destination-port, --dport, --source-port, --sport
 - Can have 0...2 destination specifiers (same direction cannot be used twice)
   --source, --src, -s, --destination, --dst, -d
 - Can have 0...2 interface switches in [General] section (same direction cannot
   be used twice):
   --in-interface, -i, --out-interface, -o

Rules can be commented out with hash tag (#) as first character. Commented rules
are simply ignored. For example:

[General]
IPv4.INPUT.RULES = #-p udp -m udp --dport 23 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 24 -j ACCEPT

Will discard the first --dport 23 rule and use the second --dport 24 rule.

The targets (-j TARGET) are the same as with default iptables: ACCEPT, DROP,
REJECT, LOG and QUEUE.

Protocols (-p protocol) are the same as with iptables: tcp, udp, udplite, icmp,
icmpv6, ipv6-icmp, esp, ah, sctp, mh, dccp and the special keyword all. These
can be given in numeric format as well.

Following switches are disabled and if a rule contains any of them the rule will
be ignored:

 - All chain modifiers, since rules are added to managed chains, all chain
   modifiers are disabled: --append, -A, --delete, -D, --delete-chain, -X, 
   --flush, -F, --insert, -I, --new-chain, -N, --policy, -P, --rename-chain, -E,
   --replace, -R, --zero, -Z
 - Destination speficiers for DNAT are disabled : --to-destination,
   --from-destination
 - Fragment: -f, --fragment
 - IP family options: --ipv4, -4, --ipv6, -6
 - Some matches (with -m) are disabled (cause crash or commit errors):
   - IPv4: comment, state, iprange, recent, owner, sctp, dccp, mh, hashlimit,
     icmpv6, ipv6-icmp
   - IPv6: comment, state, iprange, recent, owner, ttl, sctp, dccp, mh,
     hashlimit, frag, icmp
 - Interface specifiers are not allowed in tethering or service type sections:
   --in-interface, -i, --out-interface, -o

General section [General]
=========================

General section contains the main static firewall rules. In this section both
RULES and POLICY types are allowed.

RULES are read from each General section and added in sequence. The last POLICY
that is defined for a CHAIN with given PROTOCOL overrules the previous
definitions.

Being static rules the interface specifiers (--in-interface, -i,
--out-interface, -o) are allowed in the General section. 

Tethering section [tethering]
=============================

The tethering mode configuration is included as builtin feature. When tethering
is enabled a default rules to accept all traffic from the tethering adapter is
used. The rules for tethering can be added later on to be more restrictive.

Tethering rules are applied only for WiFi tethering, i.e., using a hotspot.
For usb tethering the default rules apply regardless of the [tethering] rules
configuration.

The tethering rules must be complete. If there is at least one rule set, no
default rules will be added as they would make these custom rules set in
[tethering] unnecessary by allowing all traffic. Only RULES can be defined in
tethering section.

For example of allowing only DNS and DHCP refer to Example2.

Service type sections
=====================

The service type section supports only RULES type keys. The rules defined in
the service type sections are enabled when a service of that given type becomes
READY or ONLINE and are disabled when the service becomes IDLE, DISCONNECT or
FAILURE.

When a rule is enabled, it will have the interface used by the service added
into the rule. For rules in chain INPUT the interface is added as incoming
interface (-i <interface>). For rules in chains FORWARD and OUTPUT the interface
is added as outgoing interface (-o <interface>).

The service types that are supported (defined by enum connman_service_type in
include/service.h):
 - unknown
 - system
 - ethernet
 - wifi
 - bluetooth
 - cellular
 - gps
 - vpn
 - gadget
 - p2p

Examples
========

Here are some examples regarding firewall config use.

Example1: Rule loading
======================

There is main config and three configs, which are processed in order:
 1: base firewall.conf - has [General] rules and POLICY set
 2: firewall.d/10-firewall.conf - has [wifi] rules
 3: firewall.d/20-firewall.conf - has [General] rules
 4: firewall.d/30-firewall.conf - has [wifi] and [General] rules


Rules in firewall at ConnMan start:
 - Policy from 1
 - Rules:
   - Rules from 3 [General]
   - Rules from 4 [General]
   - Rules from 1 [General]

Rules in firewall after enabling WiFi
 - Policy from 1
 - Rules:
   - Rules from 2 [wifi]
   - Rules from 4 [wifi]
   - Rules from 3 [General]
   - Rules from 4 [General]
   - Rules from 1 [General]

Example2: Tethering rules to allow only DHCP and DNS
====================================================

For example following rules could be enabled to allow only DHCP and
DNS, into, e.g., /etc/connman/firewall.d/42-tethering-firewall.conf

[tethering]

IPv4.INPUT.RULES = -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
IPv6.INPUT.RULES = -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT; -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
